## API integration
This api doesn't require any authentication, so it can be used just like that and the cfg to make it work is already in the code

### Future recomendations
Some of the products have inconsistent prieces. Consider watching at market prices and compare them just like we do with this api

### Documentation data quality issues
Based on the given csv data, i only can that i couldn't find a proper API that can be used to get all the data from the csv file, since
most of the products are very specific.
